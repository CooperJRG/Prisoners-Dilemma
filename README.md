# Prisoners-Dilemma
This repository contains a Python-based simulation of the famous Prisoner's Dilemma, implemented using genetic algorithms to evolve strategies over time. The project aims to explore how different strategies compete and evolve in a repeated game setting, using a combination of game theory and evolutionary computing principles.
